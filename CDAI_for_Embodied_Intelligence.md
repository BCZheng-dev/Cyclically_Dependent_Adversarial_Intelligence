**Inpireration for the Cyclically Dependent Artificial Intelligence(CDAI) on platform of embodied intelligence**

*"Embodied Intelligence" is a core concept in the interdisciplinary fields of artificial intelligence, cognitive science, robotics, and philosophy. It challenges the traditional view of intelligence as a purely "brain-bound" computational process, arguing that:True intelligence arises from the continuous, dynamic interaction between a physical entity (such as humans, animals, or robots) and its physical and social environment.*

*Simply put, embodied intelligence emphasizes that intelligence cannot exist independently of the body and environment.*

**So we are here to make a bold assumption of RAI for embodied intelligence**
