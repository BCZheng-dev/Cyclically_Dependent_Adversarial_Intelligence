# **Cyclically Dependent Artificial Intelligence: A Framework for Self-Evolving AI**  
*Theoretical research proposal*

---

**Inspiration for a "True" Artificial Intelligence System**  
"To make AI equipped with wisdom, not just intelligence", we assume a novel architecture based on two cyclically 
dependent adversarial neural networks (GANs), including four modules, which divided in two gruops: each group 
is a completed GAN network. These networks interact through a specialized prompt transformation mechanism, 
enabling them to clearly understand and align with user intentions. Due to their cyclic dependency, the two GANs 
engage in continuous dialogue, fostering a persistent "stream of consciousness." Leveraging the inherent properties 
of GANs, the system evolves into an asymmetric dual-network model capable of autonomous learning and adaptation.

*Inspired by Nested GANs (Li et al. 2017)*


## **Core Architecture**  
Two interacting GAN pairs with cross-network feedback:
1. **Prompt-Alignment module**: Translates user intent â†’ shared latent space  
2. **Evolutionary GANs**: Generates solutions conditioned on aligned prompts  
3. **Cyclic Feedback**: Outputs re-enter opposing networks as adversarial inputs  


### **Key Features of the System**
**1. Cyclic Dependency:**
   - Two GANs are interconnected in a loop, creating a dynamic feedback mechanism.  
   - This structure allows for continuous self-improvement and knowledge refinement.  

**2. Prompt Transformation Layer:**
   - A specialized module translates user prompts into a shared semantic space.  
   - Ensures both networks accurately interpret and align with user intentions.  

**3. Asymmetric Evolution:**
   - Over time, the two GANs develop distinct functional specializations.  
   - Mimics the division of labor observed in biological systems (e.g., left-brain/right-brain).
   - Exactly, the two module can be different, e.g., loss functions, architecture divergence

**4. Continuous adversarial refinement enables emergent behavioral complexity:**
   - The cyclic interaction generates a self-sustaining "stream of thought."  
   - External memory modules enhance long-term coherence and context retention.

### **Technical Advantages**
- **Autonomous Learning**: Unlike ordinary Generative AI, the system is driven by adversarial dialogue, which let itself to learn.  
- **Intent Alignment**: The prompt transformation layer ensures user needs are accurately understood.  
- **Scalability**: The asymmetric structure allows for efficient specialization and resource allocation.

### **Challenges**
- ***No Suitable GAN Modules***:Current GAN architectures lack bidirectional cyclic training protocols required for this framework. Novel adversarial paradigms (e.g., cross-network gradient propagation) remain theoretical.
- ***The Underlying Ethical Issues***:When it is able to evolute itslef, will it be beyond human control? And we assume a control mechanisms: human-in-the-loop evolution triggers.

### **Potential Applications**
- **Creative AI**: Generating art, music, or literature with human-like creativity.  
- **Personalized Assistants**: Understanding and adapting to individual user preferences.  
- **Scientific Discovery**: Simulating hypothesis generation and testing in research.
