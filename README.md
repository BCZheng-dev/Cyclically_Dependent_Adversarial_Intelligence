# **Cyclicly Dependent Artificial Intelligence: Self-evolution**
*just an assumption, because we're unable to make it realized*

**Inspiration for a "True" Artificial Intelligence System**  
To make AI equipped with wisdom, not just intelligence, we assume a novel architecture based on two cyclically 
dependent adversarial neural networks (GANs). These networks interact through a specialized prompt transformation 
mechanism, enabling them to clearly understand and align with user intentions. Due to their cyclic dependency, 
the two GANs engage in continuous dialogue, fostering a persistent "stream of consciousness." 
Leveraging the inherent properties of GANs, the system evolves into an asymmetric dual-network model capable of autonomous learning and adaptation.


### **Key Features of the System**
**1. Cyclic Dependency:**
   - Two GANs are interconnected in a loop, creating a dynamic feedback mechanism.  
   - This structure allows for continuous self-improvement and knowledge refinement.  

**2. Prompt Transformation Layer:**
   - A specialized module translates user prompts into a shared semantic space.  
   - Ensures both networks accurately interpret and align with user intentions.  

**3. Asymmetric Evolution:**
   - Over time, the two GANs develop distinct functional specializations.  
   - Mimics the division of labor observed in biological systems (e.g., left-brain/right-brain).  

**4. Persistent Consciousness:**
   - The cyclic interaction generates a self-sustaining "stream of thought."  
   - External memory modules enhance long-term coherence and context retention.

### **Technical Advantages**
- **Autonomous Learning**: Unlike ordinary Generative AI, the system is driven by adversarial dialogue, which let itself to learn.  
- **Intent Alignment**: The prompt transformation layer ensures user needs are accurately understood.  
- **Scalability**: The asymmetric structure allows for efficient specialization and resource allocation.

### **Challenges**
- ***No Suitable GAN Modules***:This is mainly why we're unable to realize it.
- ***The Underlying Ethical Issues***:When it is able to evolute itslef, will it be beyond human control?

### **Potential Applications**
- **Creative AI**: Generating art, music, or literature with human-like creativity.  
- **Personalized Assistants**: Understanding and adapting to individual user preferences.  
- **Scientific Discovery**: Simulating hypothesis generation and testing in research.
